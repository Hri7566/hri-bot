#Hri's Bot
So I've changed some things quite a bit over the past couple months and haven't updated a thing. That's because my current project isn't open source yet. If it does become open source, it will most likely be in a different repo, since I rebuilt everything from scratch.

I've left this code up for those of you who want to get into making scripts for https://www.multiplayerpiano.com. If anything changes with MPP, I will probably update the code so that it still works with the site until something major like the client is rewritten or something.

Credit to Karl and Charsy for some very old functions in use. Special thanks to Karl, Fennece, Caution, Karma, Anonygold, and people like you who keep the community live.
