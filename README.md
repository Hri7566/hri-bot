This bot is made for https://www.multiplayerpiano.com. Currently, it's hosted in RP Room with a bunch of other bots.

Credit to Bop It for some big chunks of stuff, and the community for sticking around.

Some older functions such as getPart were made as a bodge by Charsy or something. I'm sure there's better ways to do things, but I've seen a lot worse.
