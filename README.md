Once and for all, we're getting somewhere! Even though probably nobody is going to see this, I'm still sure someone will have to come here eventually.

I've been working on this for months on end with barely anyone helping. It's finally nice to say that it's probably in alpha stage now, and not newborn.

If you want to run this yourself and you have no idea what you're doing, just download the source and run user.js with node.

If you want to rebrand this and update it yourself, make sure you give me credit.

There's still a lot to come, so be sure to check back for more!
